### Hi!

:hospital: I work for a [small NHS foundation trust](https://yeovilhospital.co.uk/) in the south west of England, and have a knack for automating myself out of jobs.

:computer: Primarily work with JavaScript and Node.js to build on interfaces between clinical systems, and to develop web APIs.
